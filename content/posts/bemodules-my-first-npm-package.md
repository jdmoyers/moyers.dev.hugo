Recently, I've gained a new motivation to do work on personal and side projects. This is actually pretty rare for me, as I spend most of my free time with my kids or playing video games with my wife. However, a new interest of mine has given me a reason to do something I've wanted to do for a while, but never had the right idea to chase.

## Diving into React

Recently, I've become _REALLY_ interested in React. I'm just starting my journey into this semi-familiar environment, and as of now I can say that I love it. React is relatively simple to learn (assuming you are already accustomed to writing JavaScript), it's fun, and the concept of components just generally vibes with how I feel web applications should be built.

With my adoration of React in mind, there are things to get used to. First of all, as a traditional front-end developer (and by traditional, I mean I started in the early 2000s), HTML in JavaScript seemed a bit backwards to me at first. Luckily, JSX eased my concerns. Where I had my biggest pain point with React, was how styles are handled.
